This repository contains all my progress regarding my Engineering Undergradute Degree Final Year (Capstone) Project. 

The project is called Abnormal ECG Classification on Arduino using TinyML. This repo contains:

1. Google Collaboratory where I developed my ML model.
2. The datasets I used for training the model, methodology of Data Preprocessing, Model Architecture, TFLite Model Conversion (to C Byte Array), Deployment to Arduino IDE.
